Welcome to the OpenVPN installer!
The git repository is available at: https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install

I need to ask you a few questions before starting the setup.
You can leave the default options and just press enter if you are ok with them.

I need to know the IPv4 address of the network interface you want OpenVPN listening to.
Unless your server is behind NAT, it should be your public IPv4 address.
IP address: 10.10.0.110

It seems this server is behind NAT. What is its public IPv4 address or hostname?
We need it for the clients to connect to the server.
Public IPv4 address or hostname: 193.40.103.103

Checking for IPv6 connectivity...

Your host does not appear to have IPv6 connectivity.

Do you want to enable IPv6 support (NAT)? [y/n]: n

What port do you want OpenVPN to listen to?
   1) Default: 1194
   2) Custom
   3) Random [49152-65535]
Port choice [1-3]: 2
Custom port [1-65535]: 11150

What protocol do you want OpenVPN to use?
UDP is faster. Unless it is not available, you shouldn't use TCP.
   1) UDP
   2) TCP
Protocol [1-2]: 1

What DNS resolvers do you want to use with the VPN?
   1) Current system resolvers (from /etc/resolv.conf)
   2) Self-hosted DNS Resolver (Unbound)
   3) Cloudflare (Anycast: worldwide)
   4) Quad9 (Anycast: worldwide)
   5) Quad9 uncensored (Anycast: worldwide)
   6) FDN (France)
   7) DNS.WATCH (Germany)
   8) OpenDNS (Anycast: worldwide)
   9) Google (Anycast: worldwide)
   10) Yandex Basic (Russia)
   11) AdGuard DNS (Anycast: worldwide)
   12) NextDNS (Anycast: worldwide)
   13) Custom
DNS [1-12]: 13
Primary: 10.10.0.101
Secondary: 8.8.8.8

Do you want to use compression? It is not recommended since the VORACLE attack make use of it.
Enable compression? [y/n]: n

Do you want to customize encryption settings?
Unless you know what you're doing, you should stick with the default parameters provided by the script.
Note that whatever you choose, all the choices presented in the script are safe. (Unlike OpenVPN's defaults)
See https://github.com/angristan/openvpn-install#security-and-encryption to learn more.

Customize encryption settings? [y/n]: y

Choose which cipher you want to use for the data channel:
   1) AES-128-GCM (recommended)
   2) AES-192-GCM
   3) AES-256-GCM
   4) AES-128-CBC
   5) AES-192-CBC
   6) AES-256-CBC
Cipher [1-6]: 6

Choose what kind of certificate you want to use:
   1) ECDSA (recommended)
   2) RSA
Certificate key type [1-2]: 1

Choose which curve you want to use for the certificate's key:
   1) prime256v1 (recommended)
   2) secp384r1
   3) secp521r1
Curve [1-3]: 1

Choose which cipher you want to use for the control channel:
   1) ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-128-GCM-SHA256 (recommended)
   2) ECDHE-ECDSA-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
Control channel cipher [1-2]: 1

Choose what kind of Diffie-Hellman key you want to use:
   1) ECDH (recommended)
   2) DH
DH key type [1-2]: 1

Choose which curve you want to use for the ECDH key:
   1) prime256v1 (recommended)
   2) secp384r1
   3) secp521r1
Curve [1-3]: 1

The digest algorithm authenticates data channel packets and tls-auth packets from the control channel.
Which digest algorithm do you want to use for HMAC?
   1) SHA-256 (recommended)
   2) SHA-384
   3) SHA-512
Digest algorithm [1-3]: 1

You can add an additional layer of security to the control channel with tls-auth and tls-crypt
tls-auth authenticates the packets, while tls-crypt authenticate and encrypt them.
   1) tls-crypt (recommended)
   2) tls-auth
Control channel additional security mechanism [1-2]: 1

Okay, that was all I needed. We are ready to setup your OpenVPN server now.
You will be able to generate a client at the end of the installation.

Tell me a name for the client.
The name must consist of alphanumeric character. It may also include an underscore or a dash.
Client name: kristo-aun-tel
